ES6 feature   : JavaScript ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced several key features to simplify code and make it more efficient. Some of the notable features include arrow functions, which provide a concise syntax for writing functions, and template literals, allowing easier string interpolation. Destructuring helps in unpacking values from arrays or objects into variables quickly. Promises and async/await improve asynchronous code handling, making it more readable and structured. Finally, let and const provide block-scoped variable declarations, reducing errors related to variable hoisting
